               Last slot should be empty once everything is randomize.

    Useful:
        - Math.random()
        - Math.floor()
        -

               FILTER: Button[16] & SET: Empty to true; "Maybe I want to filter the array first"
               FOR: every "button" in ArrayOfButtons: 
                    RANDOMIZE: the "button" and put it in slot (0 - 15)
